# Moderni Alias

Moderni Alias is a simple app made in **Flutter**.
It features an extensive croatian dictionary used for the game.
The game is simple, light (6.75MB) and doesn't use any permissions.

Despite the Google Play Store logos in the screenshots, the game will be available there at a later date.
You can download it from the 'Releases' tab.

### Game can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/jokilic/moderni_alias/releases/download/v0.9.6/moderni_alias-v096.apk).

## Things I still want to do:

- [ ] Implement 'GeneralInfo' screen

- [ ] Increase number of words in the dictionary
- [ ] Refactor 'theme' property
- [ ] Add a checkbox if special dictionary should be used and a tooltip explaining it
- [ ] Introduce English dictionary and flags to choose desired dictionary during game
- [x] Pressing the back button after the game finishes brings you back in
- [x] Make some UI changes

- [x] Implement 'HowToPlay' screen
- [x] Implement countdown sound - Last 5 seconds
- [x] Add 'focusNodes' to be able to press Enter to go to the next team name field
- [x] Make the app responsive with 'MediaQuery.of(context).size'
- [x] During normal game, clicking the (x) and continuing the game makes the Correct/Wrong buttons unusable
- [x] Add a 'Just play' button which throws you in the game and shows you a score in the end
- [x] Implement a modal when the user presses the (x) midgame

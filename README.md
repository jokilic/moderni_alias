# Moderni Alias

Moderni Alias is a simple app made in **Flutter**.
It features an extensive croatian dictionary used for the game.
The game is simple, light (6.5MB) and doesn't use any permissions.

### Game can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/jokilic/moderni_alias/raw/master/moderni_alias.apk).

## Things I still want to do:

- [ ] Implement 'HowToPlay' screen
- [ ] Implement 'GeneralInfo' screen
- [ ] Add a short (?) with a tooltip explaining about normal and quick games
- [ ] Add 'focusNodes' to be able to press Enter to go to the next team name field
- [ ] Make the app responsive with 'MediaQuery.of(context).size'
- [ ] Refactor 'theme' property
- [ ] Implement SnackBar() for the missing team names
- [ ] Implement 'Are you sure?' modal when a user presses the Back button
- [ ] Add a radio button to use only nouns, verbs, adjectives or everything
- [ ] Add a checkbox if special dictionary should be used
- [ ] Add a short (?) explaining what the special dictionary is
- [ ] Reorder teams in the score modal by the amount of points
- [x] Add a 'Just play' button which throws you in the game and shows you a score in the end
- [x] Implement a modal when the user presses the (x) midgame
- [x] Separate the constants to colors.dart & strings.dart
- [x] Add sounds for pressing buttons in-game
- [x] Clean-up the dictionary
- [x] Make all imports relative
- [x] Create a simple 'Readme.md' file

# Moderni Alias

Moderni Alias is a simple app made in **Flutter**.
It features an extensive croatian dictionary used for the game.
The game is simple, light (7.25MB) and doesn't use any permissions.

### Game can be downloaded from [HERE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.josipkilic.modernialias).

- [ ] Currently entered team names get deleted when validation fails
- [ ] Add a checkbox if special dictionary should be used and a tooltip explaining it
- [x] Introduce English dictionary and flags to choose desired dictionary during game
- [x] Add a hero section to the GeneralInfo screen and the HowToPlay screen
- [x] Update Flutter packages & Readme.md
